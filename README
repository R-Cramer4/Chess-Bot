Chess Game written with OpenGL and C++

Playble game, most valid moves are implemented

Not implemented:
- Castling
- Check (works most of the time)
- Pins and moves that would leave the king in check (Also works most of the time)
- Draw by repititon
- the end of the game (right now nothing happens upon king capture)
